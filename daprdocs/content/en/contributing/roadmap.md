Dapr encourages the community to help with prioritization. A [dedicated proposals repository exists](https://github.com/dapr/proposals) to foster discussions with the community on all future additions and/or changes to the Dapr project.

Please vote by adding a üëç on the GitHub issues for the feature capabilities you would most like to see Dapr support. This will help the Dapr maintainers understand which features will provide the most value.

Contributions from the community are always welcomed. If there are features on the proposals repo that you are interested in contributing to, please comment on the GitHub issue and include your solution proposal.
